Pig Latin is a language game played by many English-speaking children. Here are the rules for changing English words into Pig Latin:


1. For words that begin with one or more consonants, move the consonants to the end of the word and then add "ay"
• pig -> igpay
• latin -> atinlay
• star -> arstay
• three -> eethray


2. For words that begin with a vowel, simply add "way" to the end of the word
• eagle -> eagleway
• anteater -> anteaterway


3. Words that begin with "qu" are a special case. Move the "qu" to the end of the word and then add "ay"
• quit -> itquay
• queen -> eenquay


4. The letter "y" behaves like a consonant when it's the first letter. Otherwise, it behaves like a vowel.
• yellow -> ellowyay
• mystical -> ysticalmay


This python script will accept a word from a user and translate that word in Pig Latin. Only words in lower case will be tested.
