Complex Numbers Class

The class has a real number variable and an imaginary variable.

It has the appropriate "constructors" as well as the following functions:

	add( self, real, imaginary ) #This can print out the answer. 

	multiple( self, real, imaginary ) #This can also print out the answer. 

	printComplex( self )

Also includes some test codes to make sure the class is functional.
